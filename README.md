# Project 2 - Beacon

## Team Members:

This website/app is designed as a Meetup-style app where users are required to take a short Meyers-Brigg assessment test then choose three interests. They would then have the ability to post “Beacons”, i.e. meetups, with other users, and be able to see everyone’s personality types as well as their interests before actually meeting them. This would allow people to network much easier, and connect with others that have shared interests so that they can expand their network and make new friends in a way that no other app has done before.
